##  Validation Rules

- Not be `null` or blank (`isBlank()` check from Java 11 is used).
- Contain **at least one lowercase letter**.

### 2. At Least One Optional Condition
In addition to the mandatory rules, the password must satisfy **at least one** of the following:
- Minimum length of **8 characters**

If none of these are satisfied, an `InvalidPassException` is thrown with a descriptive message.
